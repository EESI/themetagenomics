#' \subsection{Taxa}{
#'   Integrates the samples over topics p(s|k) and topics
#'   over taxa p(k|t) distributions from the STM, the topic correlations from the
#'   p(s|k) component, the covariate effects from the p(s|k) component, and
#'   their relationship with the raw taxonomic abundances. The covariate effects
#'   for each topic are shown as a scatterplot of posterior weights with error bars corresponding the
#'   global approximation of uncertainty. If the covariate chosen is binary, then the posterior regression
#'   weights with uncertainty intervals are shown. This is analogous to the mean difference between factor
#'   levels in the posterior predictive distribution. For continuous covariates, the points
#'   again represent the mean regression weights (i.e., the posterior slope estimate of the
#'   covariate). If, however, a spline or polynomial expansion was used, then the figure shows the posterior estimates of
#'   the standard deviation of the predicted topic probabilities from the posterior predictive distribution.
#'   Colors indicate whether a given point was positive (red) or negative
#'   (blue) and did not enclose 0 at a user defined uncertainty interval.
#'
#'   The ordination figure maintains the color coding just described. The
#'   ordination is performed on p(k|t) via either PCoA (using either
#'   Jensen-Shannon, Euclidean, Hellinger, Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, or Chi-squared
#'   distance) or t-SNE. The latter iterates through decreasing perplexity
#'   values (starting at 30) until the algorithm succeeds. The top 2 or 3
#'   axes can be shown. The radius of the topic points corresponds to the topic
#'   frequencies marginalized over taxa.
#'
#'   The bar plot behaves in accordance with LDAvis. When no topics are chosen,
#'   the overall taxa frequencies are shown. These frequencies do not equal the
#'   abundances found in the initial abundance table. Instead, they show p(k|t)
#'   multiplied by the marginal topic distribution (in counts). To determine the
#'   initial order in which taxa are shown, these two distributions are compared
#'   via Kullback-Liebler divergence and then weighted by the overall taxa
#'   frequency. The coloration of the bars indicates the taxonomic group the
#'   individual taxa belong to. The groups shown are determined based on the
#'   abundance of that group in the raw abundance table. When a topic is
#'   selected, the relative frequency of a given taxa in that topic is shown in
#'   red.
#'
#'   \eqn{\lambda} controls relevance of taxa within a topic, which in turn is used to
#'   adjust the order in which the taxa are shown when a topic is selected.
#'   Relevance is essentially a weighted sum between the probability of taxa in
#'   a given topic and the probability of taxa in a given topic relative to the
#'   overall frequency of that taxa. Adjusting \eqn{\lambda} influences the relative weighting such
#'   that \deqn{r = \lambda x log p(t|k) + \lambda x log p(t|k)/p(x)}
#'   The correlation graph shows the topic correlations from \eqn{p(s|k) ~ MVN(mu,sigma)}.
#'   Again, the coloration described above is conserved. The size
#'   of the nodes reflects the magnitude of the covariate posterior regression weight,
#'   whereas the width of the edges represents the value of the positive
#'   correlation between the connected nodes. By default, the graph estimates
#'   are determined using the the huge package, which first performs a
#'   nonparanormal transformation of p(s|k), followed by a Meinhuasen and
#'   Buhlman procedure. Alternatively, by choosing the simple method, the
#'   correlations are simply a thresholded MAP estimate of p(s|k).
#'   }
#'
#' \subsection{Binary}{
#'   Integrates the topics
#'   over taxa p(k|t) distribution from the STM, binary covariate effects from the p(s|k) component, and
#'   their relationship with the raw taxonomic abundances. The covariate effects
#'   for each topic are shown as a scatterplot of posterior weights with error bars corresponding the
#'   global approximation of uncertainty. If the covariate chosen is binary, then the posterior regression
#'   weights with uncertainty intervals are shown. This is analogous to the mean difference between factor
#'   levels in the posterior predictive distribution. For continuous covariates, the points
#'   again represent the mean regression weights (i.e., the posterior slope estimate of the
#'   covariate). Colors indicate whether a given point was positive (red) or negative
#'   (blue) and did not enclose 0 at a user defined uncertainty interval.
#'
#'   Selecting a topic estimate generates violin plots showing the p(s|k) distribution, split based
#'   on chosen binary covariate effects. The slider
#'   allows the user to threshold the number of points shown, based on their values in p(s|k).
#'   Highlighting points in the violin plots generates bar plots that show their abundances (or
#'   relative abundances) in the raw abundance table.
#'   }
#'
#' \subsection{Continuous}{
#'   Integrates the samples over topics p(t|s) and the topics
#'   over taxa p(k|t) distributions from the STM, binary and continuous covariate effects from the p(s|k) component, and
#'   their relationship with the raw taxonomic abundances. The covariate effects
#'   for each topic are shown as a scatterplot of posterior weights with error bars corresponding the
#'   global approximation of uncertainty. If the covariate chosen is binary, then the posterior regression
#'   weights with uncertainty intervals are shown. This is analogous to the mean difference between factor
#'   levels in the posterior predictive distribution. For continuous covariates, the points
#'   again represent the mean regression weights (i.e., the posterior slope estimate of the
#'   covariate). If, however, a spline or polynomial expansion was used, then the figure shows the posterior estimates of
#'   the standard deviation of the predicted topic probabilities from the posterior predictive distribution.
#'
#'   Selecting a topic estimate generates three panels. The top panel shows the posterior estimates of the
#'   selected continuous covariate. If binary covariates were present in the model formula, then the continuous effect
#'   given the binary covariate is shown as two regression lines, along with their corresponding uncertainty intervals.
#'   The points show the true p(k|s) values determined by the STM as a function of the selected continuous covariate.
#'   The middle panel then shows the raw abundances (or relative abundances) of most relavent taxa. Relavence can be
#'   control by adjusting \eqn{\lambda} where \deqn{r = \lambda x log p(t|k) + \lambda x log p(t|k)/p(x)}
#'   If binary
#'   covariates were provided in the model formula, selected split will split the regressions based on the selected
#'   covariate. Each figure overlays a linear best fit (red) and loess fit (red) to facilitate interpretation. The bottom
#'   panel shows these taxa combined.
#'   }
#'
#' \subsection{Functions}{
#'   Integrates the taxa over topics p(t|k) and gene functions over topics p(g|k) distributions,
#'   along with and the covariate effects from the p(s|k) component. The covariate effects
#'   for each topic are shown as a scatterplot of posterior weights with error bars corresponding the
#'   global approximation of uncertainty. If the covariate chosen is binary, then the posterior regression
#'   weights with uncertainty intervals are shown. This is analogous to the mean difference between factor
#'   levels in the posterior predictive distribution. For continuous covariates, the points
#'   again represent the mean regression weights (i.e., the posterior slope estimate of the
#'   covariate). If, however, a spline or polynomial expansion was used, then the figure shows the posterior estimates of
#'   the standard deviation of the predicted topic probabilities from the posterior predictive distribution.
#'   Colors indicate whether a given point was positive (red) or negative
#'   (blue) and did not enclose 0 at a user defined uncertainty interval.
#'
#'   The upper heatmap shows p(t|k), clustered via Wards method on a user chosen distance metric. Topics are ranked
#'   to right based on the weights from the aforementioned scatterplot. The lower heatmap shows the weights for the
#'   pathway-topic interaction from the multilevel Bayesian model. Positive and negative weight estimates that do
#'   not enclose zero at a chosen uncertainty level are marked with red and blue crosses, respectively. The pathway
#'   ordering is done via Wards method on Euclidean distance.
#'   Upon selected a cell within the pathway-topic heatmap, a table of genes is returned, ranking the genes in terms of
#'   abundance that belong to a given pathway-topic combination.
