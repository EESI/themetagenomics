Description: themetagenomics provides a means to explore the structure of 16S
  rRNA surveys using a Structual Topic Model coupled with functional prediction.
  The user provides an abundance table, sample metadata, and taxonomy
  information, and themetagenomics infers associations between topics and sample
  features, as well as topics and predicted functional content. Functional prediction
  can be accomplished via Tax4Fun (for Silva references) and PICRUSt (for GreenGeenes
  references).
