Description: A means to explore the structure of 16S rRNA surveys using a Structural 
  Topic Model coupled with functional prediction. The user provides an abundance 
  table, sample metadata, and taxonomy information, and themetagenomics infers 
  associations between topics and sample features, as well as topics and predicted 
  functional content. Functional prediction can be accomplished via Tax4Fun (for 
  Silva references) and PICRUSt (for GreenGeenes references). See Woloszynek S, 
  Mell JC, Zhao Z, Simpson G, Oâ€™Connor MP, Rosen GL (2019) Exploring thematic 
  structure and predicted functionality of 16S rRNA amplicon data. PLoS ONE
